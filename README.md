# Spline Ramp

This repository contains the implementation of a puzzle game, developed for the course "Geometria Computazionale" at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano.

In this game the user has to build a curved ramp to shoot a basketball into a basket; the documentation asked is in italian and can be read on [this](https://kegbird.github.io/Spline_Ramp) page.

The repository contains the Unity project and a website with all the documentation about it.
